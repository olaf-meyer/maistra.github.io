* link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TRACING-1631[TRACING-1631] Multiple Jaeger production instances, using same name but within different namespaces, causing Elasticsearch certificate issue.  When multiple service meshes were installed, all of the Jaeger Elasticsearch instances had the same Elasticsearch secret instead of individual secrets, which prevented the Elasticsearch Operator from communicating with all of the Elasticsearch clusters.
